/*
 Stack
 
 A stack is like an array but with limited functionality. You can only push
 to add a new element to the top of the stack, pop to remove the element from
 the top, and peek at the top element without popping it off.
 
 A stack gives you a LIFO or last-in first-out order. The element you pushed
 last is the first one to come off with the next pop.
 
 Push and pop are O(1) operations.
