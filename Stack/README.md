# Stack

A *stack* is like and array but with limited functionility. You can only push to add a new element to the top of the stack, pop to remove the element from the top, and peek at the top element without popping it off.

A *stack* gives you a LIFO or Last-In-Fast-Out order. The element you pushed last is the first one to come off with the 
next pop. (A very similar datastructure, the queue, is FIFO or First-In-First-Out.)
